# Discord-Bot

Discord bot for my server

Has a suite of functions for drafting teams (for bedwars 4v4), remembering win loss records, and displaying a leaderboard

Also has functions that allows a user to save some text and retrieve it, useful for saving playlist links to use with Groovy music bots

Has functions that track custom emote usage and ranks them by their popularity
